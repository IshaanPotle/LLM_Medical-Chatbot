# LLM Medical Chatbot

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based medical chatbot leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and a vector database for accurate, context-aware medical question answering.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Domain:** Medical Question Answering
- **Core Technologies:** Python, React, Qdrant, Mistral-7B (or other LLMs)
- **Features:**
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline
  - Semantic search over medical knowledge bases (MedQuAD, PubMed, etc.)
  - Modern frontend for chat-based interaction
  - Scalable backend with RESTful APIs

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `frontend/` — React-based web UI
- `scripts/` — Data processing, retrieval, and backend scripts
- `models/` — (Large files, download separately)
- `data/` — (Large files, download separately)
- `qdrant_data/` — (Vector DB files, download separately)

## ⚡️ Quickstart

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IshaanPotle/LLM_Medical-Chatbot.git
cd LLM_Medical-Chatbot
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
- **Backend:**
  - Python 3.8+
  - Install required packages (see scripts/requirements.txt or your script headers)
- **Frontend:**
  - Node.js 18+
  - `cd frontend && npm install`

### 3. Download Large Files
This repository does **not** include large files (models, data, vector DB) due to GitHub size limits.

#### Download links:
- **Models:** [Google Drive/Dropbox/Hugging Face link here]
- **Processed Data:** [Google Drive/Dropbox/Hugging Face link here]
- **Qdrant Vector DB:** [Google Drive/Dropbox/Hugging Face link here]

> **Instructions:**
> 1. Download the files from the above links.
> 2. Place them in the corresponding folders (`models/`, `data/`, `qdrant_data/`).

### 4. Run the Backend
```bash
# Example (adjust as needed)
python scripts/backend_rag.py
```

### 5. Run the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
